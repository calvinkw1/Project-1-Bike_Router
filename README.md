## Wheel Hub
This was Project 1 of General Assembly Web Development Immersive course in January 2015. Originally the project was pure HTML/CSS/Javascript. It now uses SCSS for styles, Gulp to compile to CSS, and runs Node for package management.

## Setup
The `node_modules` folder has been excluded from the repo. After cloning this repo, be sure to run `npm install` in order to get all the packages and dependencies needed.

Run `gulp` to start watching the `scss/` folder for any styling changes made in there.
